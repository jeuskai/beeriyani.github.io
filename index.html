        The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different
        varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centres of Delhi (Mughlai
        cuisine), Rampur, Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small
        principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a
        staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from
        Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish originated[15]) as well as
        Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur, Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala
        (Malabar), Telangana, and Karnataka (Bhatkal) where Muslim communities
        were present.[11][16] According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the
        modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire
        (1526â€“1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and
        the Persian pilaf.[17] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that
        the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the
        Mughals.[18] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India
        before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[19] The
        16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between
        biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word "biryani" is of
        older usage in India.[20] A similar theory, that biryani came to India
        with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect, because there is no
        record of biryani having existed in his native land during that
        period.[19] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani,
        biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought
        to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the
        pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot
        dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish
        became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction
        between "pulao" and "biryani" being arbitrary.[11][19] According to
        Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one
        branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by
        the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[21]
